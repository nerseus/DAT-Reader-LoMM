TODO:
============================================================================================
	- Create versions of materials that have special transparency properties
		Might be the same texture but different opacity?
		Need naming translation convention so they can be created in one pass and found/referenced later
		
	- Create items first then load into reference objects
		Can skip the create later on
		
	- Transparency issues - some glass isn't working
		Sword in the stone
			Church window should be 2-sided?

	- Transparency issues - BlueWater0
	
	- Skybox mesh - replace with setting skybox on scene
	
	- Don't create prefabs for BSP meshes - just child meshes of main object
	
	- Better grouping of WorldObjects - use WorldObjectType
	
	- Add WorldObject monobehavior so the created objects can save their key properties
	
	- Create dummy materials pointing to default for missing strings.
		BSP with missing textures:
			TEXTURES\LevelTextures\Architex\Wall\BricksGranite.dtx
			TEXTURES\LevelTextures\Architex\Wall\GraniteBlockGreen.dtx
			TEXTURES\Met070.dtx
			Default
			TEXTURES\LevelTextures\E3demo\City\MetalBar.dtx
			TEXTURES\LevelTextures\Architex\Floor\MarbleOctTileBrown.dtx

	- AIRails are not tagged the same as AITrk
	
	- Create "game" script that will position player on a start node to make testing easier
			
	- Create Lights
	
	- Create Sounds
	
	- Create Scene or maybe just prefab?
	
	- Sword in stone:
		DRAGONBLADE.DAT - WorldObjects with filename-looking strings
			SwordInStone0 (SwordInStone) - DimsFile=models\props\stoneHilt.abc
			BlueWater0 (Kato) - SpriteSurfaceName=Sprites\Water\slime.spr

	- Create "Destructable" Prefabs of ABCModels with textures defined by:
		ObjectType = "DestructableProp" or "DestructableBrush"
		WorldObjects with properties:
			CustomTexture and CustomModel
			Seem to be gibs mostly?
				Name (PT_STRING) = UrnGargoyle4
				Filename (PT_STRING) = MODELS\Props\UrnGargoyle.abc
				Skin (PT_STRING) = Skins\Props\UrnGargoyle.dtx
				CustomTexture (PT_STRING) = skins\props\urngargoyle.dtx
				CustomSound (PT_STRING) = Sounds\Events\shatterpotterybig03.wav
				CustomModel (PT_STRING) = models\props\debris\urndebris.abc
				BounceSound (PT_STRING) =

	Team Number = 0 evil, 1 = good, 3 = monsters

	TranslucentWorldModel and ChromaKey
		Probably not needed...
			TranslucentWorldModel - used to create 2nd material with name suffix "_Chromakey"
				if worldObjectModel.ObjectName == "TranslucentWorldModel" || obj.objectName == "Electricity" || obj.objectName == "Door"
				ChromaKey
					Defined on the "Litech Vertex Transparent" material
					Use the Red value of the Color to indicate transparency: 255 is fully on, 128 is pretty much see through, 114 is "off"
						Green and Blue seem to have no control over transparency
					CAN work with FullBright

	SkyBox
		Shader = "Mobile/Skybox"
			Front/Back/Left/Right 	: Tiling X and Y = 0.975
			Up/Down					: Tiling X and Y = 0.98


	- Materials
		When creating materials - need to lookup:
			Find a BSPModel with a Textures[] reference to it
			If there is one, find the matching WorldObject with the same name as BSPModel. For example, "BlueWater0"
			From the WorldObject properties, look for SurfaceAlpha and use that value to set on the alpha transparency
			Or rather... If SurfaceAlpha exists and < 1 then turn on alpha transparency (from alpha channel of texture).
				COULD turn on alpha and use the "Color" of the material to set transparency - like SurfaceAlpha = 0.7 would set the Color.A = 255 * 0.7
				But that's a uniform alpha blend instead of pulling from PNG


	- Prop research:
		If Properties has "Solid" = false... ? No collision mesh?


	On Wedding day - boxes called "PortalZoneX"
		Shown with DefaultMaterial
		Acting as portals to split up the BSP?
		These are the ONLY items using DefaultMaterial.
		
		Spiders Den:
			DefaultMaterial is only used on AIBarrier:

	Other items with sounds:
		WorldObjectModel with ObjectType = WallTorch
			Translucency = 1.000
				This is the ONLY Translucency value
			FireType = 
				only FireType values are:
					1073741824 <- 4000 0000
					1065353216 <- 3F80 0000
